System Event Auditing
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. The auditing
facility allows administrators and users to track system activity for
deployments with multiple users and applications. The audit can write
the log to the console, the :term:`syslog`, a JSON file, or a BSON file.

Audit Events and Filter
-----------------------

The audit facility logs :ref:`audit-schema-operations`,
:ref:`audit-replica-set-operations`, :ref:`audit-auth-operations`,
:ref:`audit-general-operations`. By default, the audit facility logs all
these :doc:`operations </reference/audit-operations>`; however, you
may restrict the events captured using an :option:`filter
<mongod --auditFilter>` configuration option to limit the logged
events. The filter uses :ref:`query condition expression
<query-selectors>` to limit the :ref:`operations <audit-operations>`
logged.

To enable and configure auditing for MongoDB Enterprise, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing`. For examples on filtering, see
:ref:`audit-filter`.

Audit Guarantee
---------------

The auditing system writes every audit event [#filter]_ to an
in-memory buffer of audit events. MongoDB periodical writes this
buffer to disk. For events collected from any single connection, the
events have a total order: if MongoDB writes one event to disk, the
system guarantees that it has written all prior events for that
connection to disk.

If an audit event entry corresponds to an operation that affects the
durable state of the database, such as a modification to data, MongoDB
will always write the audit event to disk *before* writing to the
:term:`journal` for that entry.

That is, before adding an operation to the journal, MongoDB writes all
audit events on the connection that triggered the operation, up to and
including the entry for the operation.

.. important:: These auditing guarantees require that MongoDB runs
   with the :setting:`journal` enabled.

.. warning:: MongoDB may lose events **if** the server crashes before
   it commits the events to the audit log. The client may receive
   confirmation of the event before MongoDB commits to the audit
   log. For example, while auditing an aggregation operation, the
   server might crash after returning the result but before the audit
   log flushes.

.. [#filter] Audit configuration can include a :ref:`filter
   <audit-filter>` to limit events to audit.
